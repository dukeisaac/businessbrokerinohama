"@type": "Question","name": "How do you approach financing?",
"Keywords": ["Business Broker Atlanta"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Financing is the name of the game. Nearly all transactions in the closely-held business arena involve some form of bank financing. Given this, deals only happen when Buyers can obtain financing. Our approach is to work with the bank and the Buyer to ensure the Buyer only seeks deals they can finance. This saves a lot of time and heartache in the process. Previously, Chad owned a banking business, and Lee, one of the company&rsquo;s vice presidents has over 30 years of small business banking experience, including being an expert on the SBA loan processes. Lastly, we work with a stable of specific banks who are aggressively doing small business / SBA loans on a nationwide level. This unique approach to banking expertise &ndash; and working WITH the established banking rules, instead of against them &ndash; gives Peterson Acquisitions a unique advantage which benefits both Buyers and Sellers."
}

"@type": "Question","name": "What’s Your Valuation Process?",
"Keywords": ["Business Broker Atlanta ga"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "There are dozens of different ways to value a business, and the resulting range can be quite wide. Our approach is to mimic the way the banks place a value on the business, because banks are often financing as much as 80% or 90% of the overall transaction. In other words, if it doesn&rsquo;t pass the bank, the deal doesn&rsquo;t get done. Banking approaches to business valuation consider cashflow and debt service coverage ratios. We have found conforming with these extremely well established (many decades) banking rules leads to a valuation that works for buyers and sellers, in that the transactions get done. No bank = no deal."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Who Will Prepare The Sales Contract? You Or An Attorney?",
"Keywords": ["Business Broker Atlanta"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Contracts are an important part of the process and also a part of the process that can blow up a deal. We have a strategy where an attorney produces the documents in a manner where both Buyer and Seller win without blowing up the deal or having each part needlessly spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees."

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Financing is the name of the game. Nearly all transactions in the closely-held business arena involve some form of bank financing. Given this, deals only happen when Buyers can obtain financing. Our approach is to work with the bank and the Buyer to ensure the Buyer only seeks deals they can finance. This saves a lot of time and heartache in the process. Previously, Chad owned a banking business, and Lee, one of the company&rsquo;s vice presidents has over 30 years of small business banking experience, including being an expert on the SBA loan processes. Lastly, we work with a stable of specific banks who are aggressively doing small business / SBA loans on a nationwide level. This unique approach to banking expertise &ndash; and working WITH the established banking rules, instead of against them &ndash; gives Peterson Acquisitions a unique advantage which benefits both Buyers and Sellers.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>There are dozens of different ways to value a business, and the resulting range can be quite wide. Our approach is to mimic the way the banks place a value on the business, because banks are often financing as much as 80% or 90% of the overall transaction. In other words, if it doesn&rsquo;t pass the bank, the deal doesn&rsquo;t get done. Banking approaches to business valuation consider cashflow and debt service coverage ratios. We have found conforming with these extremely well established (many decades) banking rules leads to a valuation that works for buyers and sellers, in that the transactions get done. No bank = no deal.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Contracts are an important part of the process and also a part of the process that can blow up a deal. We have a strategy where an attorney produces the documents in a manner where both Buyer and Seller win without blowing up the deal or having each part needlessly spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.</p>
